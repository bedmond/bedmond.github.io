So now I'm tackling Ruby and then Rails in an effort to gain more experience in development by learning a new language and broadening my base of knowledge. I've been kickstarted by my mentor at [Bloc.io][Bloc], [Kevin McGillivray][KevinMcGillivray] who is gracious enough to continue pointing me in the right direction to grow my web dev bag of tricks.

I like this object-orientated language so far, it lays out and is expressed in a manner that resonates a little better with me than Javascript does (I sheepishly write). I guess that could be due to the syntax structure. It seems to be written in a manner that goes down a little easier, a little more logical than formulaic. Check out these two code snippets for For Loops from the [jumpstartlabs][jumpstartlabs] tutorial, ruby in a 100 minutes.

Javascript For Loop

{% highlight javascript %}
for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
  console.log("Hello, World");
}
{% endhighlight %}

vs. Ruby For Loop

{% highlight ruby %}
5.times do
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
{% endhighlight %}

I mean, to me, one snippet comes off a little clearer than the other though I do have a much better grasp of these things than I did some ten months ago. Maybe I'm just a little better.

Well, here's to learning and making bigger and better things and hoping it all makes sense at some point in the near future.

Cheers!
