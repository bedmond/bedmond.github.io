Get it on with blocitoff!
Get organized with blocitoff and find out what matters.

This is an Angularjs app designed to help organize and prioritze time spent on tasks. The logic is such that the tasks remain 'active' for seven days and then are auto-completed with the understanding that any task left 'active' that long wasn't important enough to field in this list.  The user can enter their task and designate the task completed and can also drag and drop the tasks to sort them into order of importance. Otherwise the order is set by entry from top down.

The bloc-time app utilizes Firebase as the backend which also allows for Regitration and Login capabilty. This functionality is mandatory to utilize the app functionality.

The app is mobile ready and intuitive with no obfuscation reagrding the functinality.
