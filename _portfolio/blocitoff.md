Get it on with blocitoff!
Get organized with [blocitoff][blocitoff] and find out what matters.

This is an Angularjs app designed to help organize and prioritize time spent on tasks. The logic is such that the tasks remain 'active' for seven days and then are auto-completed with the understanding that any task left 'active' that long wasn't important enough to field in this list.  The user can enter their task and designate the task completed and can also drag and drop the tasks to sort them into order of importance. Otherwise, the order is set by entry from the top down.

The bloc-time app utilizes Firebase as the backend which also allows for registration and login capability. This is required to view and utilize the app functionality.

The app is mobile ready and intuitive with no obfuscation regarding the functionality.
