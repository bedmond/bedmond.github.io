Start-Stop. bloc-time, yeah!
Get productive with the Pomodoro method and bloc-time. Produce produce!

The bloc-time app makes use of the productivity philosopy and method incorporated in the Pomodoro technique. This is a method that adheres to the logic that prescribed lengths of time for working and taking a break produce higher quality work while maintaining efficiency without burn-out.

This app requires that you enter a task, a job that you are working on, and then apply lengths of time to that task for both working and taking a break. The break times are adhered to strictly and cannot include anything work related. These are the moments that allow for focus and rest that create more productivity during the timed work sessions.

This app utilizes Firebase as the back end and stores your entered tasks unless you actively remove them. No need to watch the timer as an alert sound will let you know when to shift gears.
