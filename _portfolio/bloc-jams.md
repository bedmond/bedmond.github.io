[Bloc Jams][bloc-jams] is a little Rdio clone built as an assignment for Bloc.io to help me learn Jquery and then Angularjs. This app is a heavy piece of coding that was great as an immersive tutorial to structuring a complicated app with many interdependent and moving parts.  Reconfiguring the app from Jquery to Angularjs's single page application structure is where I really learned to appreciate the SPA in all of its speed, readability, and economy of motion.

Check out the code at:  [bedmond's bloc-jams Github repo][bedmond-gh].
