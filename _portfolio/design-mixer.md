[design-mixer][design-mixer] is an online portfolio with a JS upload to Amazon S3 storage. Paint, design, shoot, and mix it up!

This app utilizes Angularjs, Firebase, and Amazon S3 cloud storage to upload, store, and display images of all kinds. The app is designed to function as on online portfolio of cool, creative things. I intend to use this to display and store my art, design, and photography; eventually making the site and app open to any who'd like to do the same. I really like the idea of a randomized, mixed-up display of art.

I'll continue to refactor and develop this app and site so check back every now and then. Thanks!
