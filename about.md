Hello. That's me.  I'm an artist, photographer, and developer that's a big fan of activities that require a book (like reading) and/or an ocean (like paddleboarding). I have a BA in Fine Art and Art History, a permanent gig as a pro photographer that specializes in lifestyle shoots like weddings and portraiture, and I'm newly minted in the creatively satisfying world of web development with a focus on plain Javascript and Angularjs.  I've also worked for a number of years in the world of stock photography and currently hold down a position as a senior Content Manager and Channel Manager in an agency that's been around the block a couple of times.

You could say I'm a real big fan of making things and using them in the real world. I dream them, I make them, I manage them, I live them.

You can find out a little bit more about my development projects at:  [bedmond's Github repo][bedmond-gh].
