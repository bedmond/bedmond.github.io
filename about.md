Hello. That's me.  I'm a creative and hard working guy seeking to contribute to a quality organization. Through serving in a variety of roles, I have accumulated experience managing the content of a digital media agency with an archive of more than thirteen million images. The intricacies of managing a collection of this size, while working with diverse suppliers from around the world, required that I display expert skills as a relationship builder, content strategist, designer, special project manager, out-of-the-box thinker, and problem solver. The job demanded the determination to find solutions from a variety of resources, understanding that good questions lead to great answers. I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity to prove that I excel in these tasks, and Iâ€™m confident that these skills have prepared me for success on any job.

Educated in the Arts, I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Painting with a Minor in Art History from the University of North Florida, graduating Magna Cum Laude. Excellent craftsmanship is required to successfully execute complex concepts and ideas in a work of art; these skills are often instinctively applied in strategic thinking and task completion in a variety of situations.

I continue to learn and add disciplines to my comprehensive set of skills, while viewing challenges as opportunities for improvement. I believe this quality is mandatory to succeed in the workplace and in life. Learn, improve, utilize, repeat is the mantra that guides and drives me.
